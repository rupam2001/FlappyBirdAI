# FlappyBirdAI
Using genetic algorithm and neural networks from scratch.
Each generation gets more and more better and reaches a saturation point and becomes unbeatable!
(No machine learning library has been used. It is for demonstrating the basics of genetic algorithm. It is my first Reinforcement learning project)
